# Hello there!

For this i focused heavily on testability, maintainability and expandability. This is made to be quite easily changed into a http server or something other than a console experience. The repositories can also be swapped to make it use a database instead of file storage and so forth. If any other file format is wanted, the FileManager interface can be extended and easily swapped.
